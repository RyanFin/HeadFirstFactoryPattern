# HeadFirstFactoryPattern

Practising the factory design pattern from [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do). 

## Factory Pattern
The factory pattern is useful for instantiating many objects from a single factory with different types. The abstract Factory superclass does not contain any concrete implementation values, therefore allowing it to decouple client code.
